# Slow-Clock

I first learned about a slow watch from a co-worker who was many years my senior. I was talking with him in the office when I noticed the funny-looking watch on his wrist. Even though I had just asked him about his bolo tie (hey, he had true Western style), I had to ask him about his watch. As he explained the concept of a slow watch to me, I absolutley fell in love with the idea behind it.

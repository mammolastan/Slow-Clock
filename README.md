# Slow-Clock

I first learned about a slow watch from a co-worker who was many years my senior. I was talking with him in the office when I noticed the funny-looking watch on his wrist. Even though I had just asked him about his bolo tie (hey, he had true Western style), I had to ask him about his watch. As he explained the concept of a slow watch to me, I absolutley fell in love with the idea behind it.

## What is a slow clock?

The core of the slow watch is the 24 hour one-hand concept.

A 24 hour one-hand clock allows you to see the entire day in one view and experience time in natural way. This fundamentally changes the way you look at the clock and can promote enhanced consciousness about the progression of your day.

This way of showing the time is inspired by the original clocks that were based on the sun clock. Those early clocks indeed had only one hand and displayed all 24 hours. You can still see them on some old church towers. Only when people’s lives became busier and busier they felt a need to create this unnatural split of the day in two 12-hour halves and break each hour down in to 60 minutes. That’s when we started to chase the minutes and get stressed by time.
